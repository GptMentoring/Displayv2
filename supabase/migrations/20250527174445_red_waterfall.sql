/*
  # Fix content_items RLS policy for sort order updates
  
  1. Changes
    - Drop existing update policy
    - Create new policy that properly handles sort order updates
    - Simplify the policy logic to avoid complex subqueries
    - Add explicit role check
  
  2. Security
    - Maintains RLS protection
    - Ensures authenticated users can only update sort_order
    - Prevents modification of other fields during sort_order updates
*/
